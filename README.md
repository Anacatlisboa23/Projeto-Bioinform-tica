# Identification of drug targets for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ from Biomedical Literature
Ana Lisboa PG49831


This repository was created within the scope of the Bioinformatics Project, containing the materials I used for the completion of my project titled "Identification of drug targets for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* from Biomedical Literature".

Where you can find:

- `paper.py` file with the class I created.
- `EuropePMC\_wrapper.py` a file with a series of Python functions to retrieve articles and annotations from the Europe PMC API.
- `pipeline` notebook where all methods performed in the entire workflow can be found.
