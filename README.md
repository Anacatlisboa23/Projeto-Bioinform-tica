# Identification of drug targets for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ from Biomedical Literature

This repository was created within the scope of the Bioinformatics Project course, containing the materials I used for the completion of my project titled "Identification of drug targets for Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Biomedical Literature".

Where you can find:

- A "Paper.py" file withe the class I created.
- "EuropePMC\_wrapper.py" a file with a series of Python functions to retrieve articles and annotations from the Europe PMC API.
- A "pipeline" notebook where all methods performed in the entire workflow can be found.
